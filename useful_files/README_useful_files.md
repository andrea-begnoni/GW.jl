## GWJULIA (a.k.a. GW.jl)

This folder contains useful files for the code, they are divided in:
- Waveform files (in the folder WFfiles)
- Power Spectral Densities (in the folder PSDs)


### Waveform Files (WFfiles)

These files are used to interpolate the PhenomD quasinormal modes, this can be useful to speed up a bit the calculation. This procedure is used by LAL and GWFAST so we kept it to reach the same results


### Power Spectral Densities (PSDs)

Note that power spectral densities are the square of the amplitude spectral densities(ASD) $PSD = ASD^2$. The code offers both _readASD() and _readPSD() accordingly.

The files can have 2 or 4 columns, the first one is always the freuencies and the last one is always the full PSD. In the case there are 4 columns there are the PSD for high and low frequncies (HF and LF). 
To select different columns from the function _readPSD(..., cols = [1,4]) where the first index is the frequency and the second one is the PSD.

Inside this folder there are the Power Spectral Densities (or ASD) divided in 3 sub-folder:
- curves\_Jan\_2020
- ET\_curves
- CE\_curves
- LVC\_O1O2O3
- observing\_scenarios\_paper


#### curves\_Jan\_2020
ASD curves from [LIGO](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T1500293/public) 

#### ET\_curves
ET curves (updated 23/3) from ET collaboration [link](https://apps.et-gw.eu/tds/?content=3&r=18213) plus ETD from [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0908). Note that there is a pdf document inside the folder explaining the curves updated at 23/3. 


#### CE\_curves

Cosmic Explorer ASDs from [*Science-Driven Tunable Design of Cosmic Explorer Detectors*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10668), available at [https://dcc.cosmicexplorer.org/cgi-bin/DocDB/ShowDocument?.submit=Identifier&docid=T2000017&version=](https://dcc.cosmicexplorer.org/cgi-bin/DocDB/ShowDocument?.submit=Identifier&docid=T2000017&version=).

The folder contains ASDs for:

* the baseline 40km detector (```cosmic_explorer```)
* the baseline 20 km detector compact binary tuned (```cosmic_explorer_20km```)
* the 20 km detector tuned for post-merger signals (```cosmic_explorer_20km_pm```)
* the 40 km detector tuned for low-freqency signals (```cosmic_explorer_40km_lf```)


#### LVC_O1O2O3/

The folder contains ASDs for the LIGO and Virgo detectors during their O1, O2 and O3 observing runs, extracted in specific moment from actual data.

Available at [https://dcc.ligo.org/P1800374/public/](https://dcc.ligo.org/P1800374/public/) for O1 and O2, [https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2000251/public](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2000251/public) for O3a, and computed using [PyCBC](https://pycbc.org) around the times indicated in the caption of Fig. 2 of [https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03606](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03606).

#### observing\_scenarios\_paper/

ASDs used for the paper [*Prospects for observing and localizing gravitational-wave transients with Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA*, KAGRA Collaboration, LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41114-020-00026-9).
